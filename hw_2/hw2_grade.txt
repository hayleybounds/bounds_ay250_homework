Problem 1: 3/5
----------------------------------------
1/1: plot with caption
2/4: analysis

Your analysis was a little vague; like, what disadvantage in particular
does a bar plot have here? 

Here are some things that struck me about this plot that I don't think
you noted (but I realize that different fields have different standards):
- the labels for data are all very small, almost unreadable
- rather than plotting data on axes, it seems that someone pulled a page out of 
  cartography and just gives scales of the data? Which is weird. Like, axes
  aren't even labeled? 
- Also I can't tell what's an inset and what isn't (partly because there
  are no axes)
  
In terms of describing the "story" of a plot to people outside your field,
do note that the *significance* of "the channel that they genetically inserted 
into the neuron causes current to flow into the neuron upon exposure to light,"
i.e. what that adds to human knowledge, ought to be explained when you are 
describing a plot.

Problem 2: 4/7 
----------------------------------------
2/3: Recreated plot
3/3: New dynamic interactions
0/1: Analysis of changes
-1: export issues (see next problem)

Your plot isn't the box-and-whisker plot of the original data design.
The interactivity you implemented could have been usefully executed 
for just the outliers on a box-and-whisker plot.

Based on your answer, it seems like you implemented interactivity
without thinking about why/what would be helpful :\

Problem 3: 3/5
----------------------------------------
4/5: Reproduced plot: title, twin_x, legend, limits, linestyles
-1: export issues

no font variety

I had to rewrite your code to check it because of the way you handled
data retrieval. In the future:
(1) Don't fully specify paths to "local" data; e.g. rather than
'/home/hayley/bounds_ay250_homework/hw_2/hw_2_data/*'
use
'hw_2_data/*'
(2) "glob" doesn't necessarily return the same order on every machine.
The way your code is written, it doesn't work for me because hw_2_data
isn't in your git repo and the original hw_2_data only has 5 files so
the index 5 is out of bounds.

Extra Credit: 1/10

1/3: subplots in matplotlib
0/5: rectangular region identifier
0/2: execution

Is that a Spongebob reference??
